# snakes
My very first programming project (a snake game), made in C++ between 2011 and 2013. Requires SDL. There are many things I'd do better now (see my [Snakes game written in Kotlin](https://github.com/TakingItCasual/JavaSnakes) as an example), but I wanted to save this since I spent so long on it.
