# snakes
My very first programming project, made in C++. Requires SDL. Made between 2011 and 2013. There are many things I'd do differently now (see my [TIS-100 clone](https://github.com/TakingItCasual/TakingItCasual.github.io) and [mc-ec2](https://github.com/TakingItCasual/mc-ec2), more recent projects), but I wanted to save this since I spent so long on it.
